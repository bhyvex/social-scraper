# Scraper pattern file for picurls.com website
#
# This is another pattern filtering format that the scraper accepts.
# 
# Here we can specify a list of predicates as perl subroutines which
# get called on each item found on the site being scraped.
#
# If the predicate subroutine returns true, the item gets accepted.
# If it returns false, it gets discarded and the next subroutine gets
# called until all of them have either failed or one has accepted the item.
# 
# WARNING: code must be correctly indented, otherwise program will fail
#          to extract the perl subroutine.
# 

#
# These patterns are mostly for social bookmarking (sb) sites, where people
# do not write "[PIC]" or "(Pic)" in title.
#

# Discard items which point to index pages
#
