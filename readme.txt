Social scraper is a Perl program and a bunch of Perl modules (plugins) that
scrape various social websites, such as reddit, digg, stumbleupon, delicious,
flickr, simply, boingboing, wired, for content that matches the given
patterns.

This program was written by Peteris Krumins (peter@catonmat.net).
His blog is at http://www.catonmat.net  --  good coders code, great reuse.

The program was written as a part of picurls.com website (currenly broken,
will fix some time later). The social scraper Program was described in this
article:
